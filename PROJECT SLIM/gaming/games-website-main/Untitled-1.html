  <p>Riot Games’ tactical first-person 5v5 shooter proved to be an instant hit when it got released in June 2020. <br>
     Although the game takes a few cues from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, the availability of heroes across <br>
      different game modes in the game including Unranked, Spike Rush, and Deathmatch makes it worth a shot. <br>

    Throughout the game, there are a lot of weapon skins and agents to unlock, which incentivizes gamers to stick <br>
     around and experience intense competition from other players. <br>
      That said, you have the option to purchase Valorant Points to skip the queue and access agents and shiny skins.

<p>One of the best first-person shooters of the recent years. Overwatch quickly gathered the attention of millions of players <br>
   worldwide with its flashy gameplay and colorful graphics. Each character in the game comes with an amazing and deep backstory that <br> 
   tells you why they are doing, what they are doing.
  Overwatch is a great mix of shooters and MOBAs that brings the best of both worlds together. <br> You get the fast-paced gameplay of a shooter mixed <br>
   with the elements from a MOBA where  you get different abilities and powerful heroics to overpower your enemies.
In a 5v5 match, your goal is <br> to kill all your enemies and complete the required objective of the game. It’s a fast-paced shooter that’s definitely worth a try.

<p>Counter Strike has been one of the most popular first-person shooter games on PC. It started as a mod for Half-Life back in the days but quickly <br> grew big enough to become  a standalone game. 
   Counter Strike: Global Offensive is the current incarnation of the game and carries a massive fan following. <br> This game is highly competitive with a very big eSports scene backing it up. 
    Counter Strike: GO is a traditional shooter where you get to join either <br> the terrorists or counter-terrorists.

  The terrorists have a bomb that they must plant in any one of the specific locations available on the map and the CT must try <br>
   to either disable the planted bomb or keep the terrorists from planting it. It’s a battle of strategy and wits, and also quick aim. While the game is now available to play for free, <br> if you’re thinking of playing competitive games, you should purchase the prime status to get matched with non-hacking, hopefully non-toxic players.</p>

    <p>Apex Legends is another game that has quickly risen to popularity in the online gaming world. The game was released in February 2019 by EA <br>
       and has been primarily developed for Windows PCs and other gaming consoles. In short, Apex Legends is a battle-royale game just like Fortnite. <br>
        As for the game, here you play in a three-man squad on an island of 20 such squads.

      And with the recent update, you can also play alone or in a squad of two players. <br>
       You have to defeat all other squads by searching for weapons, supplies, ammunition and finding answers to mysterious clues on the way. <br>
        The last standing squad wins the game.
      
      Other than that, Apex Legends is set in a sci-fi universe and if you have played Titanfall then you would find many <br>
       commonalities between the two games. The gaming environment is largely similar because Respawn Entertainment has developed both the games.
      <br>
       I think Apex Legends has great gameplay and there are many elements that make it unique. If you love playing Fortnite then definitely try Apex Legends. <br> Many experts believe that Apex Legends is a worthy competitor to Fortnite and rightly so.</p>
